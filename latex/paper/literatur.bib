  abstract  = {The field of Music Information Retrieval has always acknowledged the
need for rigorous scientific evaluations, and several efforts have set out to develop
and provide the infrastructure, technology and methodologies needed to carry out
these evaluations. The community has enormously gained from these evaluation fo-
rums, but we have reached a point where we are stuck with evaluation frameworks
that do not allow us to improve as much and as well as we want. The community
recently acknowledged this problem and showed interest in addressing it, though
it is not clear what to do to improve the situation. We argue that a good place to
start is again the Text IR field. Based on a formalization of the evaluation process,
this paper presents a survey of past evaluation work in the context of Text IR,
from the point of view of validity, reliability and efficiency of the experiments. We
show the problems that our community currently has in terms of evaluation, point
to several lines of research to improve it and make various proposals in that line.},

Retrieval (MIR) systems and algorithms are dependent on the development of ri-
gorous measures of accuracy and performance such that meaningful comparisons 
among current and novel approaches can be made. This is the motivating prin-
ciple driving the efforts of the International Music Information Retrieval Systems 
Evaluation Laboratory (IMIRSEL) and the annual Music Information Retrieval 
Evaluation eXchange (MIREX). Since it started in 2005, MIREX has fostered 
great advancements not only in many specific areas of MIR, but also in our gen-
eral understanding of how MIR systems and algorithms are to be evaluated. This 
chapter outlines some of the major highlights of the past four years of MIREX 
evaluations, including its organizing principles, the selection of evaluation me-
trics, and the evolution of evaluation tasks. The chapter concludes with a brief in-
troduction of how MIREX plans to expand into the future using a suite of Web 
2.0 technologies to automated MIREX evaluations.},
